-- Looks like this is the only possible realisation.
-- For example:
--    contains :: PSet a -> a -> Bool
--    f :: a -> b
--    
--    I can execute function f on element of type a, with the result of type b.
--    But I can't use type b in 'contains'. 
--    So, I can realise fmap only for a -> a functions. But it's not enough for Functor instance
